## JavaScript Dom Assignment

## 11/25/24

## Description

Using JavaScript, I created functions that allowed me to target specific boxes and change the background color of them using input fields and buttons.

## Peer Review: Santiago Jesus Montanez

- Everything works fine as intended.
- I would be careful how you set up your colors.
  - If a user were to mispell or type a value not in your set parameter then the color would be set to white.
    - Example: If I were to target box 1 and mispell "purple" as "purpel" it will appear as nothing and no alert is given
    - Example #2: If were to want to change box 1 from purple to blue and mispell "blue" as "bluee" it will become white
- Otherwise everything worked as what was needed for the assignment. Good work
